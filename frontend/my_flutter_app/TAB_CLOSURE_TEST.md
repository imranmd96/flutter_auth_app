# 🔒 Tab Closure Security Test Guide

## 🚀 **Enhanced Security is LIVE!**

**URL**: `http://localhost:3001`

Your Flutter app now has **enhanced tab closure protection** - when you close all tabs and wait 5+ minutes, you'll be redirected to login even if you were authenticated!

## 🧪 **Step-by-Step Security Test**

### **🎯 Test 1: Enhanced Tab Closure Security (Primary Test)**

#### **Step 1: Login and Establish Session**
1. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:3001/login`
2. Login with credentials:
   - **Email**: `imran@com.com`
   - **Password**: `123456`
3. Navigate to dashboard, profile, settings (establishes tab activity)
4. **Result**: ✅ Normal access, session active

#### **Step 2: Close ALL Browser Tabs**
1. **Important**: Close **ALL** browser tabs/windows
2. **Wait 6+ minutes** (longer than 5-minute security timeout)
3. **Open DevTools Console** (F12) to see security logs

#### **Step 3: Try Direct Route Access**
1. Open new browser tab
2. Navigate directly to: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
3. **Expected Result**: 🔒 **Redirected to login screen**
4. **Security Status**: ✅ **ENHANCED SECURITY WORKING**

#### **Step 4: Check Console Logs**
```javascript
// You should see logs like:
🔒 [timestamp] Session invalidated due to tab closure timeout
   lastActivity: [previous timestamp]
   timeSinceLastActivity: 6 minutes
   timeout: 5 minutes

🔒 [timestamp] Session invalidated due to security policy
   path: /dashboard
   reason: Tab closure timeout
```

### **🎯 Test 2: Quick Tab Reopening (Should Allow Access)**

#### **Step 1: Login and Quick Close**
1. Login to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Use the app normally
3. Close all tabs
4. **Immediately** (within 2-3 minutes) open new tab

#### **Step 2: Try Route Access**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
2. **Expected Result**: ✅ **Access granted**
3. **Reason**: Within 5-minute security window

### **🎯 Test 3: Continuous Session (Normal Usage)**

#### **Step 1: Keep One Tab Open**
1. Login and open dashboard
2. Keep one tab open
3. Wait 10+ minutes while using the app

#### **Step 2: Navigate Around**
1. Go to profile, settings, etc.
2. **Expected Result**: ✅ **Continuous access**
3. **Reason**: Session remains active with continuous usage

## 📊 **Security Behavior Summary**

| Scenario | Time Since Last Tab Activity | Result | Reason |
|----------|----------------------------|--------|---------|
| Quick return | < 5 minutes | ✅ Access granted | Within security window |
| Extended closure | > 5 minutes | 🔒 Redirect to login | Security timeout |
| Continuous usage | N/A (active) | ✅ Access granted | Session active |
| Browser crash | < 5 minutes | ✅ Access granted | Recovery window |

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **Security Console Logs**
```javascript
// Normal activity:
🔒 Tab Activity Recorded

// Security trigger:
🔒 Session invalidated due to tab closure timeout
🔒 Redirecting to Login
   from: /dashboard
   reason: Security check failed
```

### **localStorage Inspection**
1. Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
2. Look for keys:
   - `flutter.last_tab_activity` - Timestamp of last activity
   - `flutter.session_active` - Boolean session status

### **Network Tab**
1. Check DevTools → Network
2. Verify no unauthorized API calls when redirected
3. Only login page resources should load

## 🛡️ **Security Scenarios Tested**

### **✅ Scenario 1: Shared Computer Protection**
```
User logs in → Closes browser → Leaves computer (6+ min)
↓
Someone else tries to access → 🔒 BLOCKED (redirected to login)
```

### **✅ Scenario 2: Normal User Workflow**
```
User working → Briefly closes tabs → Returns quickly (< 5 min)
↓
Continues working → ✅ ALLOWED (seamless experience)
```

### **✅ Scenario 3: Browser Recovery**
```
Browser crashes → User restarts immediately
↓
Tries to continue work → ✅ ALLOWED (recovery window)
```

## ⚙️ **Customization Options**

### **Adjust Security Timeout**
```dart
// In lib/auth/login/utils/security_config.dart
static const Duration tabClosureTimeout = Duration(minutes: 10); // More lenient
static const Duration tabClosureTimeout = Duration(minutes: 2);  // More strict
```

### **View Current Settings**
```dart
// Current configuration:
Tab Closure Timeout: 5 minutes
Session Timeout: 24 hours
Max Session Age: 7 days
Token Refresh: 5 minutes
```

## 🎯 **Expected Test Results**

### **✅ Enhanced Security Working**
- **Tab closure + 6 min wait**: 🔒 Redirected to login
- **Quick tab reopening**: ✅ Access granted
- **Continuous usage**: ✅ Uninterrupted access
- **Security logging**: 📝 Events recorded in console

### **🔍 Troubleshooting**

#### **Issue**: Still getting access after 6+ minutes
**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser cache/localStorage
2. Ensure ALL tabs were closed
3. Check console for security logs

#### **Issue**: Getting redirected too quickly
**Solution**: 
1. Check if timeout is set correctly
2. Verify tab activity is being recorded
3. Look for error logs in console
